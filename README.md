# Lab Two: Encryption

**Author**: William Adams  
**Course**: IS 3513-002 ‚Äì Cyber Security  
**Date**: October 8, 2023  
**Instructor**: Professor Wooldridge  

## üìö Overview

This project demonstrates foundational concepts in encryption using **Kleopatra** and **OpenPGP**. The lab focused on encrypting and decrypting text files and emails to gain hands-on experience with public key infrastructure (PKI) and digital privacy.

## üîê Objectives

- Understand the importance of encryption in securing digital communication.
- Install and configure Kleopatra for email/file encryption.
- Create and manage OpenPGP key pairs.
- Send encrypted messages via email.
- Receive and decrypt encrypted messages using Kleopatra.
- Explore the role of PKI in cybersecurity.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used

- [Kleopatra (Gpg4win)](https://www.gpg4win.org/)
- Windows Operating System (due to compatibility with Kleopatra)
- Notepad (for creating plaintext messages)
- Email (for testing encrypted communication)

## üöÄ Key Steps Completed

1. Installed Kleopatra on a Windows laptop.
2. Created an OpenPGP key pair.
3. Imported the instructor‚Äôs public key.
4. Sent an encrypted email using the public key.
5. Decrypted a received encrypted message from the instructor.
6. Resolved initial issues with using a Mac for the lab by switching to a Windows machine.
7. Explored the real-world applications and significance of PKI.

## üí° Reflections

- First time using Kleopatra and encrypting messages.
- Found the encryption/decryption process intuitive once the software was installed.
- Encryption is a powerful tool in ensuring confidentiality and integrity of information.
- PKI plays a critical role in organizational security and data protection.
